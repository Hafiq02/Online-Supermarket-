c program of an online supermarket system

Final sem project during my foundation year learning c program My first ever programming language :)

This C program presents a simple command-line based supermarket shopping and payment system. It allows users to select items, specify quantities, enter their address for delivery, and choose a payment method. The available items and their prices are listed, and the program calculates the total price, including delivery fees. Users can pay with a credit or debit card, opt for cash on delivery, or choose online banking with options for specific banks. The code efficiently handles input validation, and upon successful payment, it displays a transaction confirmation message. .
